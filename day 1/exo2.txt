Question:

An array is monotonic if it is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing. an array is monotone increasing if all its elements from left to right are non-decreasing.an  array is monotone decreasing if all its elements from left to right  are non-increasing. Given an integer array return true if the given array is monotoci or false otherwise

Clarifying the question 
-Is an empty array monotonic? yes
-Is an array with only 1 integer monotonic ? yes

Test cases : 

[1 , 2 , 3]  true , (ND, MI)
[3,2,1] True , (NI ,  MD)
[1,2,2]
